                <h1><span id="about-link"></span>Hi, I'm <span>Sam.</span></h1><br>
                <p>I started my fitness journey at a very young age, when I was eight years old, my parents opened health clubs in Worcestershire called PF2 Health Clubs. Ever since then, fitness has been a huge part of my life, from my Mum convincing me to attend her Bodypump classes in my school holidays, spending five years working within my family’s business, to creating my own Fitness Training business. I have huge amounts of passion when it comes to my client’s health and wellbeing, by forming strong relationships, I work with my clients on their fitness journeys by giving them one on one support, motivation, pushing them to their limits and breaking through barriers to ensure we can create the best results from their training.<br><br> I am a personal trainer who is based in Worcester with clients within Worcester, Droitwich and Malvern. With my latest online services I can now train my clients virtually from all around the world. With my support, I can offer my clients, full dedication to their fitness goals, one hundred percent support and guidance down to their eating habits, their independent training either at the gym or at home, as well as their one on one sessions.<br><br> Group exercise is another huge passion of mine, I am qualified to teach aerobics classes, circuits, HIIT, spinning, kettlebells, step aerobics, as well as four Les Mills Programmes including, Bodyattack, Bodycombat, Bodypump and GRIT. Being in that group environment creates a phenomenal atmosphere where I can connect, engage and motivate all of my participants in front of me. Watching people give their all into an exercise and smiling whilst sweating is incredible, the classes are always filled with a mix of fun and hard work to ensure you get the best workout possible. Back in 2019 myself and three of my team mates competed against other gyms around the country in the LES MILLS GRIT CHAMPIONSHIPS 2019, where we trained hard, dedicated hours of practice and worked strategically as a team to compete in the competition in London. We won the competition and took home the trophy, this also was mentioned in the Worcester News newspaper and online.</p>

                    always there for support, I love all the classes he teaches. He has been a rock to me and many more throughout this lockdown and without his online HIT classes I think I probably would have given up weeks ago! He encourages you every step of the way, even when you really want to give up. Brillant Sam, keep doing what you do best."</p>
